  <h1>Surah Al-‘Ankabut – The Spider</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 69</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Al-‘Ankabut, revealed in Makkah, is the twenty-ninth chapter of the Quran. 
    It addresses themes of faith, trials, and steadfastness in the face of persecution. 
    The surah opens by warning believers that claiming faith will inevitably be tested, 
    and that true sincerity is proven through patience and endurance. 
    It recounts the struggles of earlier prophets such as Nuh (Noah), Ibrahim (Abraham), Lut (Lot), Shu‘ayb, and Musa (Moses, peace be upon them), 
    showing how they faced rejection but were ultimately supported by Allah. 
    The central metaphor of the spider’s fragile web illustrates the weakness of false gods compared to Allah’s strength. 
    The surah calls Muslims to cling firmly to faith, remain steadfast against opposition, and trust in Allah’s promise of victory and eternal reward.

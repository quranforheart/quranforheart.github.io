  <h1>Surah Az-Zukhruf – Ornaments of Gold</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 89</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Az-Zukhruf, revealed in Makkah, is the forty-third chapter of the Quran. 
    Its name, meaning “Ornaments of Gold,” refers to the material wealth and adornments that people often idolize. 
    The surah emphasizes the dangers of pride, attachment to worldly wealth, and the rejection of divine guidance. 
    It recounts the stories of previous prophets, including Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses), peace be upon them, and the opposition they faced from their people. 
    The chapter highlights the contrast between those who are grateful to Allah and those who follow vain desires. 
    It emphasizes the truth of the Quran, the reality of resurrection, and the ultimate reward for the righteous versus the punishment for the disbelievers.

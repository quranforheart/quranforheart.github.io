  <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #2c3e50;">Frequently Asked Questions About the Quran</h2>

  <h3>1. Is the Quran violent?</h3>
  <p>The Quran does mention war, but usually in the context of self-defense or historical events. These verses are often misunderstood or taken out of context. The Quran encourages peace, justice, and forgiveness. For example:</p>
  <blockquote>"Whoever kills a soul‚Ä¶ it is as if he had slain mankind entirely." (Quran 5:32)</blockquote>
  <blockquote>"There is no compulsion in religion." (Quran 2:256)</blockquote>

  <h3>2. Does the Quran oppress women?</h3>
  <p>Not at all. In fact, the Quran uplifted the rights of women at a time when they were often denied basic dignity. It introduced rights like inheritance, consent in marriage, and education. Some negative practices in Muslim societies come from culture, not the Quran. The Quran promotes spiritual equality:</p>
  <blockquote>"Men and women are allies of one another." (Quran 9:71)</blockquote>
  <blockquote>"The most noble of you in the sight of God is the most righteous‚Ä¶" (Quran 49:13)</blockquote>

  <h3>3. Was the Quran copied from the Bible?</h3>
  <p>The Quran shares some figures with earlier scriptures (like Moses and Noah), but it offers its own distinct stories and moral messages. It calls itself a confirmation and clarification of past revelations:</p>
  <blockquote>"To you We have revealed the Book in truth, confirming what came before it and as a guardian over it." (Quran 5:48)</blockquote>

  <h3>4. Why is the Quran only in Arabic?</h3>
  <p>The Quran was revealed in Arabic because it was addressing the people of Arabia first, just as earlier prophets spoke in their local languages. Today, millions read translations while preserving the original Arabic for consistency and accuracy. The Quran itself says:</p>
  <blockquote>"We have not sent a messenger except [speaking] in the language of his people‚Ä¶" (Quran 14:4)</blockquote>

  <h3>5. Is the Quran anti-science?</h3>
  <p>No. The Quran encourages reflection, observation, and seeking knowledge. It isn't a science textbook, but many of its verses align with scientific understanding (like the development of the embryo, the expanding universe, or the water cycle). It invites people to think:</p>
  <blockquote>"Do they not reflect upon themselves?" (Quran 30:8)</blockquote>

  <h3>6. Why does the Quran talk about Hell?</h3>
  <p>The Quran speaks about both Paradise and Hell to awaken moral responsibility. Hell is not a threat but a warning ‚Äî and the Quran always pairs justice with mercy. God's mercy is emphasized throughout:</p>
  <blockquote>"My mercy encompasses all things." (Quran 7:156)</blockquote>

  <h3>7. Is the Quran angry or loving?</h3>
  <p>The Quran‚Äôs tone is deeply compassionate. It begins almost every chapter with: "In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate." It constantly invites people to return to goodness, forgiveness, and gratitude:</p>
  <blockquote>"And We have not sent you [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds." (Quran 21:107)</blockquote>

  <p style="margin-top: 2rem; font-style: italic; color: #555;">We understand these questions come from genuine curiosity. We invite you to explore the Quran with an open heart ‚Äî and form your own impressions.</p>

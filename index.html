You have to understand that it is impossible to master the Quran because the Quran text applies to every period of time and every group of humanity.

      <h3 id="q1">1. Is the Quran violent?</h3>
      <p>The Quran does mention war, but usually in the context of self-defense or historical events. These verses are often misunderstood or taken out of context. The Quran encourages peace, justice, and forgiveness.</p>
      <blockquote>"Whoever kills a soul… it is as if he had slain mankind entirely." (Quran 5:32)</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"There is no compulsion in religion." (Quran 2:256)</blockquote>
      <h3 id="q2">2. Does the Quran oppress women?</h3>
      <p>Not at all. In fact, the Quran uplifted the rights of women at a time when they were often denied basic dignity. It introduced rights like inheritance, consent in marriage, and education.</p>
      <h3 id="q3">3. Was the Quran copied from the Bible?</h3>
      <p>The Quran shares some figures with earlier scriptures (like Moses and Noah), but it offers its own distinct stories and moral messages.</p>
      <h3 id="q4">4. Why is the Quran only in Arabic?</h3>
      <p>The Quran was revealed in Arabic because it was addressing the people of Arabia first. Translations exist today to help readers understand its meaning.</p>
      <h3 id="q5">5. Is the Quran anti-science?</h3>
      <p>No. The Quran encourages reflection, observation, and seeking knowledge. It invites people to think:</p>
      <blockquote>"Do they not reflect upon themselves?" (Quran 30:8)</blockquote>
      <h3 id="q6">6. Why does the Quran talk about Hell?</h3>
      <p>The Quran mentions both Paradise and Hell to awaken moral responsibility. God's mercy is emphasized throughout.</p>
      <h3 id="q7">7. Is the Quran angry or loving?</h3>
      <p>The Quran’s tone is deeply compassionate. It begins almost every chapter with: "In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate."</p>
      <h3 id="q8">8. What is the meaning of Allah?</h3>
      <p>The word <strong>"Allah"</strong> is the Arabic term for <em>God</em> — the one and only Supreme Being in Islam.</p>

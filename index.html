    <h2>Why Read the Quran?</h2>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>Is the Quran only for Muslims?</strong><br/>
    No. The Quran presents itself as a message for all people — encouraging everyone to think, reflect, and engage with its words.</p>

    <p><strong>Is the Quran violent?</strong><br/>
    The Quran discusses conflict — often in historical or self-defense contexts — but overwhelmingly calls for peace, justice, and patience. Verses are often misunderstood when read without context.</p>

    <p><strong>Do I need to read in Arabic?</strong><br/>
    No. While Arabic is the original language, accurate translations help non-Arabic speakers understand the message clearly.</p>

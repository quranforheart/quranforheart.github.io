  <h1>Surah Al-Waqi‘ah – The Inevitable</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 96</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Al-Waqi‘ah, revealed in Makkah, is a powerful chapter focusing on the certainty of the Day of Judgment, known as “the Inevitable.” 
    It vividly describes the great upheaval of the Last Day when humanity will be divided into three groups: the foremost in faith, the people of the right hand, and the people of the left hand. 
    The surah details the unimaginable rewards of Paradise for the righteous, including eternal youth, gardens, rivers, fruits, and noble companions. 
    In contrast, it warns of the torment awaiting the deniers, with scorching fire, boiling water, and darkness. 
    The chapter also emphasizes Allah’s power in creation—such as life, death, crops, fire, and water—reminding humans of their dependence on Him. 
    It closes by affirming the truth of the Quran and the inevitability of accountability, urging reflection and preparation for the Hereafter.

  <h1>Surah Al-Anbiya – The Prophets</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 112</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Al-Anbiya, revealed in Makkah, is the twenty-first chapter of the Quran. 
    It emphasizes the closeness of the Day of Judgment, the futility of false gods, and the unity of divine revelation. 
    The surah recounts the lives of many prophets—such as Ibrahim, Nuh, Musa, Dawud, Sulayman, Ayyub, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, Maryam, and Isa (peace be upon them all)—showing their struggles, patience, and steadfastness in calling to truth. 
    Through their examples, believers are reminded that trials are part of faith, and ultimate success belongs to those who trust Allah and persevere. 
    The chapter also stresses mercy, forgiveness, and the universality of the prophetic message.

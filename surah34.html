  <h1>Surah Saba – Sheba</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 54</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Saba, revealed in Makkah, is the thirty-fourth chapter of the Quran. 
    It focuses on Allah’s blessings, the certainty of the Hereafter, and the consequences of gratitude versus denial. 
    The surah highlights the stories of Prophet Dawud (David, peace be upon him) and Prophet Sulayman (Solomon, peace be upon him), both of whom were granted unique blessings and authority. 
    It also recalls the prosperous people of Sheba, who became ungrateful and were ultimately destroyed. 
    The chapter contrasts the arrogance of disbelievers who deny resurrection with the humble submission of the believers. 
    It emphasizes that wealth and children are not sources of true success; rather, faith and good deeds lead to eternal reward.

  <h1>Surah Al-Qasas – The Stories</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 88</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Al-Qasas, revealed in Makkah, is the twenty-eighth chapter of the Quran. 
    It focuses heavily on the story of Prophet Musa (Moses, peace be upon him), 
    beginning with his birth, protection by Allah, and upbringing in Pharaoh’s palace. 
    The surah recounts his flight from Egypt, his time in Madyan, and his divine mission to call Pharaoh to worship Allah. 
    The narrative illustrates Allah’s protection of the oppressed and His destruction of tyrants. 
    Another important account is the story of Qarun (Korah), whose arrogance and attachment to wealth led to his downfall. 
    The surah reassures the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) that his mission is divinely guided, 
    and it contrasts the fleeting nature of worldly life with the eternal rewards of the Hereafter.

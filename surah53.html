  <h1>Surah An-Najm – The Star</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 62</h2>

  <p>
    Surah An-Najm, revealed in Makkah, is the fifty-third chapter of the Quran. 
    Its name, “The Star,” comes from the opening verse where Allah swears by the star as it descends. 
    The surah emphasizes the truthfulness of the Prophet Muhammad’s (ﷺ) message, affirming that he speaks by divine revelation, not personal desire. 
    It describes his miraculous journey, the Mi’raj, where he witnessed great signs near the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary. 
    The chapter refutes idolatry, exposes the futility of false gods, and reminds people of past nations destroyed due to arrogance. 
    It concludes with a powerful call to prostration, urging humanity to humble themselves before Allah.

  <h1>Surah Az-Zumar – The Groups</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 75</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Az-Zumar, revealed in Makkah, is the thirty-ninth chapter of the Quran. 
    It highlights the themes of sincerity in worship, the futility of associating partners with Allah, and the inevitability of the Day of Judgment. 
    The surah contrasts the fate of the believers and disbelievers, stressing that deeds will be judged with perfect justice. 
    It calls people to turn back to Allah in repentance before it is too late, and reminds them of His vast mercy as well as His severe punishment. 
    The imagery of people entering Paradise in groups and others being driven to Hell in groups gives the surah its title, “The Groups.” 
    The surah ends with a majestic scene of the angels surrounding Allah’s Throne, glorifying Him as justice is established.

  <h1>Surah Al-Hashr – The Exile</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Madani | Verses: 24</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Al-Hashr, revealed in Madinah, derives its name “The Exile” from the expulsion of the Banu Nadir, a Jewish tribe, from Medina due to their betrayal and conspiracy against the Muslim community. 
    The surah addresses the consequences of treachery, the importance of unity, and obedience to Allah and His Messenger. 
    It emphasizes Allah’s attributes, His knowledge, and the accountability of all beings. 
    The chapter also guides believers on the proper distribution of spoils, charity, and support for the needy while highlighting moral and ethical conduct. 
    The concluding verses glorify Allah and provide a profound reflection on His majesty, mercy, and omnipotence, inspiring mindfulness, humility, and sincere devotion.

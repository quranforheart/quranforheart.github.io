  <h1>Surah Al-Mujadila – The Woman Who Disputes</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Madani | Verses: 22</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Al-Mujadila, revealed in Madinah, addresses social and community issues, beginning with the case of a woman who came to the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) complaining about her husband’s unjust practice of <em>zihār</em> (an ignorant pre-Islamic form of divorce). 
    Allah responded to her plea, abolishing this unfair practice and setting clear rules for expiation. 
    The surah emphasizes that Allah hears all conversations, public and private, and warns against secret councils that exclude or harm others. 
    It highlights the distinction between those who ally with Allah and His Messenger and those who oppose them, noting that true believers are loyal to the truth even against their own relatives. 
    It also stresses discipline, respect in gatherings, and obedience to Allah’s commands, portraying a vision of a just, morally conscious society rooted in fairness and accountability.

  <h1>Surah Ghafir – The Forgiver</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 85</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Ghafir, also known as Surah Al-Mu’min, is the fortieth chapter of the Quran and was revealed in Makkah. 
    The surah emphasizes Allah’s mercy and forgiveness, while also warning of His punishment for those who persist in disbelief. 
    It recounts the stories of past nations who rejected their prophets and faced destruction, particularly focusing on Pharaoh and his people. 
    The surah includes the story of a believing man from Pharaoh’s household who courageously defended the truth, showing how faith can thrive even in hostile environments. 
    The chapter highlights the contrast between arrogance and humility, urging people to reflect on creation, seek forgiveness, and prepare for the Hereafter. 
    It closes by reaffirming that messengers were always opposed, but the ultimate victory belongs to Allah and His faithful servants.

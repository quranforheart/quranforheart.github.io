  <h1>Surah Al-Hadid – The Iron</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Madani | Verses: 29</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Al-Hadid, revealed in Madinah, emphasizes the greatness of Allah, the fleeting nature of worldly life, and the importance of faith, charity, and striving in the cause of Allah. 
    It opens by glorifying Allah as the Sovereign of the heavens and earth, reminding believers of His absolute power and knowledge. 
    The surah urges Muslims to spend in charity, using wealth as a means to attain closeness to Allah, while warning against miserliness and attachment to worldly pleasures. 
    It highlights the distinction between believers and hypocrites on the Day of Judgment, with light guiding the faithful while hypocrites are left in darkness. 
    The surah also stresses that worldly life is temporary—like play, amusement, and competition—whereas the Hereafter is everlasting. 
    It concludes by affirming the mission of previous prophets, the role of scriptures, and the significance of iron as both a means of strength and a test for humanity, symbolizing justice and accountability.

  <h1>Surah Ya-Sin – Ya-Sin</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 83</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Ya-Sin, revealed in Makkah, is the thirty-sixth chapter of the Quran and often called the “heart of the Quran.” 
    It emphasizes the truth of the Quran and the prophethood of Muhammad (ﷺ). 
    The surah contains vivid reminders of past nations who rejected their messengers and faced destruction. 
    It highlights signs of Allah in creation — such as the earth, plants, the alternation of night and day, and celestial bodies — all pointing to His oneness. 
    The surah strongly stresses the reality of resurrection, accountability, and the contrast between the destiny of believers and disbelievers. 
    It closes by affirming Allah’s absolute command: He only says “Be,” and it is.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Opens with an oath by the Quran, affirming the Prophet’s truthfulness and mission.</li>
    <li>Recounts the story of messengers sent to a town, showing the rejection of truth and the reward of a believing man.</li>
    <li>Points to natural phenomena as signs of Allah’s existence and power.</li>
    <li>Warns disbelievers about the certainty of resurrection and judgment.</li>
    <li>Describes scenes from the Day of Judgment, where people will face the consequences of their deeds.</li>
    <li>Promises Paradise to the righteous, where they will enjoy peace, blessings, and eternal joy.</li>
    <li>Depicts the fate of disbelievers in Hell, where they will face humiliation and torment.</li>
    <li>Closes with Allah’s supreme power: His command is instantaneous — “Be,” and it comes into existence.</li>
  </ul>

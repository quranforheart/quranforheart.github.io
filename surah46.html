  <h1>Surah Al-Ahqaf – The Wind-Curved Sandhills</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 35</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Al-Ahqaf, revealed in Makkah, is the forty-sixth chapter of the Quran. 
    Its name, meaning “The Wind-Curved Sandhills,” refers to the barren region inhabited by the people of ‘Ad, an ancient nation mentioned in the surah. 
    The surah emphasizes the consequences of arrogance, disbelief, and rejection of divine guidance. 
    It recounts the story of the people of ‘Ad and their prophet Hud (peace be upon him), highlighting the destruction that befell those who defied Allah. 
    The chapter stresses the importance of obedience, humility, and reflection on the signs of Allah in nature and history. 
    It also reassures the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) and the believers that patience, trust, and steadfastness will be rewarded.

  <h1>Surah Al-Jathiya – The Crouching</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 37</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Al-Jathiya, revealed in Makkah, is the forty-fifth chapter of the Quran. 
    Its name, meaning “The Crouching,” refers to the posture of people on the Day of Judgment as they await their reckoning. 
    The surah emphasizes Allah’s signs in creation, His guidance, and the consequences of rejecting the truth. 
    It calls attention to the contrast between those who submit to Allah and those who follow vain desires. 
    The chapter reminds humanity of the inevitability of accountability, the reward for the righteous, and the punishment for disbelievers. 
    It also encourages reflection on the blessings of Allah and urges gratitude, humility, and sincere worship.

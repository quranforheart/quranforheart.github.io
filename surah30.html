  <h1>Surah Ar-Rum – The Romans</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 60</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Ar-Rum, revealed in Makkah, is the thirtieth chapter of the Quran. 
    It begins with a prophecy that the Romans, after being defeated by the Persians, would soon achieve victory — a sign of Allah’s power over history. 
    The surah emphasizes the certainty of resurrection and the futility of denying Allah’s signs. 
    It points to natural phenomena, human creation, and the order of the universe as evidence of divine wisdom. 
    The chapter also stresses that worldly pleasures are temporary while the Hereafter is everlasting. 
    Believers are encouraged to remain steadfast in worship, establish prayer, give charity, and avoid arrogance. 
    The surah concludes by assuring the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) and his followers that truth will prevail and that patience is key to success.

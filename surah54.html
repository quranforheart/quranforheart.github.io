  <h1>Surah Al-Qamar – The Moon</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 55</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Al-Qamar, revealed in Makkah, is the fifty-fourth chapter of the Quran. 
    Its name, “The Moon,” refers to the miraculous splitting of the moon shown as a sign to the Quraysh. 
    Despite witnessing miracles, the disbelievers accused the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) of sorcery. 
    The surah strongly warns against denial of truth by recalling the destruction of earlier nations such as the people of Nuh, ‘Ad, Thamud, the people of Lut, and Pharaoh. 
    Each example highlights the consequences of arrogance and persistent rejection of divine guidance. 
    Repeatedly, Allah emphasizes that the Quran is made easy for remembrance, but many still turn away. 
    The chapter closes with reassurance that the righteous will be in gardens and rivers, honored in the presence of the Almighty.

  <h1>Surah Al-Fatiha – The Opening</h1>
  <p>
    Surah Al-Fatiha is the first chapter of the Quran and is often referred to as 
    "The Opening." It consists of seven verses and holds a central place in Islamic worship, 
    being recited in every unit of prayer (Salah). 
  </p>
  <p>
    The Surah emphasizes the oneness of Allah, His mercy, and His role as the Master of the Day of Judgment. 
    It is both a supplication for guidance and a reminder of the straight path followed by those 
    who earned Allah’s favor. It serves as a foundation for the entire Quran, 
    encapsulating its central themes of faith, worship, and reliance on divine guidance.

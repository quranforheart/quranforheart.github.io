  <h1>Surah Al-Furqan – The Criterion</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 77</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Al-Furqan, revealed in Makkah, is the twenty-fifth chapter of the Quran. 
    It derives its name from the word "Al-Furqan," meaning "The Criterion" — a reference to the Quran as the standard 
    by which truth is distinguished from falsehood. The surah emphasizes the greatness of Allah, 
    the truth of the Quran, and the mission of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) as a warner to all humanity. 
    It challenges the disbelievers’ arguments, their mockery, and their demands for miracles. 
    It also paints vivid pictures of the Day of Judgment, when false gods will disown their followers. 
    The surah concludes with the qualities of the “Servants of the Most Merciful” (ʿIbad al-Rahman), 
    who embody humility, patience, and devotion.

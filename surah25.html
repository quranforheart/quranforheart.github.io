  <h1>Surah Al-Hajj – The Pilgrimage</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki & Madani | Verses: 78</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Al-Hajj, partly revealed in Makkah and partly in Madinah, is the twenty-second chapter of the Quran. 
    It derives its name from the institution of Hajj (pilgrimage), emphasizing its spiritual and unifying role in Islam. 
    The chapter addresses themes of resurrection, accountability, sacrifice, and submission to Allah. 
    It vividly describes the horrors of the Day of Judgment, the fate of the disbelievers, and the rewards for the believers. 
    Surah Al-Hajj also highlights the sanctity of the Sacred Mosque (Kaaba), the rites of pilgrimage, and the unity of mankind in worshiping Allah. 
    It further emphasizes struggle in Allah’s path, obedience, and the importance of upholding the truth.

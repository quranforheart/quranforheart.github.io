  <h1>Surah Fatir – The Originator</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 45</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Fatir, also known as “The Originator,” is the thirty-fifth chapter of the Quran, revealed in Makkah. 
    It emphasizes Allah’s role as the Creator of the heavens, the earth, and all life. 
    The surah highlights His mercy, wisdom, and control over creation. 
    It contrasts the destinies of believers and disbelievers, urging reflection on the signs of nature as proofs of Allah’s power. 
    The chapter also stresses that guidance comes only from Allah, and that human beings are accountable for their own choices. 
    It concludes by reminding that Allah does not hasten punishment, but if He were to seize people for their sins immediately, none would be left on earth.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Praises Allah as the Creator of the heavens, the earth, and the angels with wings of varying numbers.</li>
    <li>Emphasizes Allah’s mercy and power in controlling life, death, and sustenance.</li>
    <li>Warns that no one can withhold what Allah grants, nor grant what He withholds.</li>
    <li>Encourages reflection on natural signs such as rain, vegetation, and the alternation of day and night.</li>
    <li>Highlights the difference between those who see (believers) and those who are blind (disbelievers).</li>
    <li>Stresses that guidance is in Allah’s hands alone; prophets can only deliver the message.</li>
    <li>Promises Paradise for the righteous and eternal loss for those who reject the truth.</li>
    <li>Concludes by warning that Allah could punish instantly, but out of mercy, He gives respite until an appointed time.</li>
  </ul>

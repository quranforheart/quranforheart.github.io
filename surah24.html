  <h1>Surah An-Nur – The Light</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Madani | Verses: 64</h2>

  <p>
    Surah An-Nur, revealed in Madinah, is the twenty-fourth chapter of the Quran. 
    It focuses on laws that safeguard morality, family structure, and social order within the Muslim community. 
    The surah provides detailed rulings on issues such as punishment for adultery, false accusations, and the importance of modesty. 
    It emphasizes the concept of purity, both physical and spiritual, and gives guidance on behavior within homes and society. 
    A central verse of this surah is the famous “Ayat an-Nur” (Verse of Light), which beautifully describes Allah’s light as the source of all guidance. 
    The surah also calls for obedience to the Prophet (ﷺ) and emphasizes mutual respect, chastity, and discipline in the Muslim community.

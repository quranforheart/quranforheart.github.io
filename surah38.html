  <h1>Surah Sad – Sad</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 88</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Sad, revealed in Makkah, is the thirty-eighth chapter of the Quran. 
    It emphasizes the truth of the Quran, the consequences of arrogance, and the ultimate triumph of truth. 
    The surah highlights the rejection of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) by the Quraysh, who resisted his message out of pride and attachment to tradition. 
    It recounts the stories of past prophets and leaders such as Dawud (David), Sulayman (Solomon), and Ayyub (Job), peace be upon them, illustrating lessons of justice, wisdom, gratitude, and patience. 
    The surah also describes the rebellion of Iblis (Satan) when he refused to bow to Adam, establishing the theme of pride as the root of disobedience. 
    It concludes by affirming that the Quran is a reminder for all humanity and that its truth will eventually be realized.

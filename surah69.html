  <h1>Surah Al-Haqqah – The Inevitable</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 52</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Al-Haqqah, revealed in Makkah, focuses on the inevitability of the Day of Judgment and the consequences of human actions. 
    The surah begins by describing the overwhelming reality of the “Inevitable” and the events of the Day of Judgment, emphasizing that denial and mockery of this truth will bring severe punishment. 
    It recounts the fate of past nations such as the people of Pharaoh, Aad, and Thamud, who rejected their prophets and faced destruction. 
    The chapter highlights the distinction between the righteous, who will receive rewards and bliss, and the disbelievers, who will endure torment. 
    It calls people to reflect on their deeds, prepare for the Hereafter, and seek Allah’s mercy and guidance.

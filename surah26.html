  <h1>Surah Ash-Shu‘ara – The Poets</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 227</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Ash-Shu‘ara, revealed in Makkah, is the twenty-sixth chapter of the Quran. 
    It emphasizes the truth of divine revelation and the repeated rejection of messengers throughout history. 
    The surah recounts the stories of past prophets — including Musa (Moses), Ibrahim (Abraham), Nuh (Noah), Hud, Salih, Lut (Lot), and Shu‘ayb (peace be upon them) — 
    each of whom called their people to worship Allah alone and live righteously, yet most were rejected. 
    The surah reminds the Quraysh of these lessons, warning them against arrogance and disbelief. 
    It also addresses poets and orators, distinguishing between those who mislead with falsehood and those who use their words to uphold truth and faith. 
    The overarching theme is that guidance and success come only from Allah, while rejection of His message leads to destruction.

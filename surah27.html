  <h1>Surah An-Naml – The Ant</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 93</h2>

  <p>
    Surah An-Naml, revealed in Makkah, is the twenty-seventh chapter of the Quran. 
    It highlights Allah’s power, the truth of revelation, and the certainty of resurrection. 
    The surah is named after the story of the ant who recognized Prophet Sulayman (Solomon, peace be upon him) and warned its community. 
    It emphasizes that knowledge and power are blessings from Allah, not reasons for arrogance. 
    Several stories of past prophets are recounted, including Musa (Moses), Dawud (David), Sulayman (Solomon), and Salih (peace be upon them), 
    illustrating the consequences of faith and disbelief. The narrative of Sulayman’s communication with animals and his encounter with the Queen of Sheba (Bilqis) 
    demonstrates how true submission to Allah surpasses worldly power. The surah concludes with reminders of the Hereafter and Allah’s ultimate justice.

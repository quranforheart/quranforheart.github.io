  <h1>Surah As-Saffat – Those Who Set the Ranks</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 182</h2>

  <p>
    Surah As-Saffat, revealed in Makkah, is the thirty-seventh chapter of the Quran. 
    It opens by swearing an oath on the angels who line up in ranks to glorify Allah, emphasizing His oneness and majesty. 
    The surah refutes false claims about Allah having offspring, particularly the claim of the pagans that angels were His daughters. 
    It describes the fate of disbelievers in Hell and the rewards awaiting the righteous in Paradise. 
    The chapter recounts the stories of earlier prophets — including Nuh (Noah), Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses), Harun (Aaron), Ilyas (Elijah), and Lut (Lot), peace be upon them — highlighting their struggles, sacrifices, and Allah’s support. 
    It particularly emphasizes Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice his son in obedience to Allah, a supreme example of submission. 
    The surah concludes by affirming that Allah’s promise of victory for His messengers and the believers is certain.

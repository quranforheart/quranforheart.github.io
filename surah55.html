  <h1>Surah Ar-Rahman – The Most Merciful</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki (some say Madani) | Verses: 78</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Ar-Rahman, often called “the Bride of the Quran,” is one of the most eloquent and rhythmic chapters. 
    It highlights Allah’s infinite mercy, blessings, and favors upon humanity and jinn, repeatedly asking the rhetorical question: 
    <em>“So which of the favors of your Lord will you deny?”</em> This refrain emphasizes gratitude and reflection. 
    The surah details both worldly and spiritual blessings—such as the creation of humans and jinn, the balance of the universe, fruits, seas, and pearls. 
    It also contrasts the destinies of the righteous and the wicked, describing the punishment of the disbelievers and the reward of the believers with vivid imagery of gardens, flowing rivers, and eternal delights. 
    The chapter concludes by glorifying Allah, the Lord of Majesty and Honor, reminding creation of their complete dependence on Him.

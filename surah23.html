  <h1>Surah Al-Mu’minun – The Believers</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 118</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Al-Mu’minun, revealed in Makkah, is the twenty-third chapter of the Quran. 
    It begins by describing the qualities of true believers who will attain success, 
    emphasizing faith, prayer, modesty, honesty, and trustworthiness. 
    The surah recounts the stories of earlier prophets such as Nuh (Noah), Musa (Moses), and Isa (Jesus, peace be upon them), 
    highlighting the rejection they faced from their people. It warns against arrogance, disbelief, and heedlessness of the Hereafter, 
    while reminding mankind of the stages of human creation as a sign of Allah’s power. 
    The surah concludes by contrasting the fate of the disbelievers and the rewards of Paradise for the faithful.

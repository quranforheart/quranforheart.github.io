  <h1>Surah As-Sajdah – The Prostration</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 30</h2>

  <p>
    Surah As-Sajdah, revealed in Makkah, is the thirty-second chapter of the Quran. 
    It emphasizes the truth of the Quran, the creation of mankind, resurrection, and ultimate accountability. 
    The surah portrays the stark contrast between the destiny of believers and disbelievers. 
    It stresses the importance of humility, remembrance of Allah, and prostration as a symbol of submission.

    The surah concludes by urging patience in the face of denial and mockery, reminding that the disbelievers will ultimately face the reality of their choices.

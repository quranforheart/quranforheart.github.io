  <h1>Surah Luqman – Luqman</h1>
  <h2>Classification: Makki | Verses: 34</h2>

  <p>
    Surah Luqman, revealed in Makkah, is the thirty-first chapter of the Quran. 
    It emphasizes the wisdom of Luqman, a righteous man, who advised his son about faith, gratitude, and righteous conduct. 
    The surah highlights the importance of avoiding shirk (associating partners with Allah), establishing prayer, showing humility, and practicing patience. 
    It also reminds humanity of Allah’s signs in creation, urging reflection on the heavens, earth, and the balance of life. 
    The chapter concludes with the reminder that ultimate knowledge of the unseen—such as the Hour, the wombs, and future provisions—belongs only to Allah.
